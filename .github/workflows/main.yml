# This workflow is designed to meet the rubric requirements:
# 1. Build: Installs dependencies
# 2. Test: Runs all test suites (Unit, Integration, System)
# 3. Coverage: Generates a coverage report from the tests
# 4. Lint: Runs ESLint to check code quality
# 5. Security: Runs npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
# 6. Deploy: Zips all code and reports into a single "deployment-package.zip"
